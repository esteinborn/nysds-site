  Alert banners are designed to display critical information, updates, or
  warnings that require the user's attention.
   
  The `<nys-alert>` component is a banner-like component that appears at the top of a screen to prominently display important information, along with optional links. Alerts keep users informed of important and sometimes time-sensitive changes.

usage: >
  ### When to use this component

    - Use `<nys-alert>` to communicate important, time-sensitive information to users in a visually prominent way.
    - Ideal for messages such as success notifications, danger alerts, warnings, or informational updates.
    - Use for dismissible or temporary alerts when the message is not critical to user workflow.

  ### When to consider something else

    - If the information is not time-sensitive or critical, consider using an inline message.
    - Avoid using alerts for repetitive or non-actionable content that could frustrate users.
do: >-2
    - Keep the alert content concise and focused on the message.
    - Use the default icon alert icon, displayed on the left, unless you need to communicate critical information visually such as a pandemic or widespread power outage.
    - Make alerts dismissible unless they contain critical information or an important step users need to take.
    - Limit alerts to one per page; if more than one alert is needed, prefer Base alerts if possible to not overwhelm users.
    - Use Success type to confirm a positive system status to users such as saving a form.
    - Use Danger type to display system status error messages.
    - Only use Emergency type for actual emergencies such as a mission person, weather, or power outage; consider switching the left icon to a relevant icon if one exists.
    - [Dev] Use the appropriate `theme` (e.g., `info`, `success`, `warning`, or `danger`) to match the intent of the alert.
    - [Dev] Use the `dismissible` property for non-critical alerts, allowing users to clear them from the screen.
dont: >2
    - Don't remove the left icon; the icon is required for accessibility.
    - Do not use an alert to call attention to what a user needs to do in a screen instead of making the action clear in the screen itself.
    - Do not use error messages to communicate form field validation issues; use field error states instead.
    - Don't include more than two link actions in an alert.
    - Don't overuse alerts for non-critical information, as this can desensitize users to important messages.
    - Don't use alerts as toasts. alerts should be placed directly on the page at the top of the screen content.
    - Don't add any shadows to alerts.
accessibility: >-
  The `<nys-alert>` component includes the following accessibility-focused
  features:

    - Users with colorblindness use the alert's icon to differentiate the alert type; for accessibility it is best to use the default icon.
    - Keyboard navigation support, allowing users to use voiceover to read the alert using the keyboard.
    - Visual focus indicators to help users navigate the component.
    - Each alert theme contains an ARIA role attribute that can notify assistive technologies of time-sensitive and important messages.

  | **ARIA Role**   | **Attribute**                                                                                                                             | **Use Case**                                                                 |

  | `role="region"` | Messages that provide information the user would want to be able to easily find, but are not important enough to interrupt user workflow. | Information and Warning alert (An `aria-label` will be added for this role.) |

  // Select the alert component const alert =
  document.querySelector("nys-alert"); /* 
     * Consider persisting dismissal state (e.g., to localStorage or analytics)
     * This can be used to prevent the alert from appearing again

      ### Custom text description


      Add descriptive content to your alert using the `text` prop or the our slot feature. 


      Use the `text` prop for simple texts, or leverage the slot by simply putting HTML elements within our component for advanced HTML customizations, such as links or styled texts.
    examplecode: >
      <nys-alert type="success" heading="Custom Descriptions">

      <p>This is a custom alert with <strong>HTML content</strong>.</p>
