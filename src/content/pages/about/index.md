# About the New York State Design System

## Our Vision

A team dedicated to improving design system maturity and creating a core set of design resources and guidelines to support product work at the state.

## Our Mission

### Consistent & Coherent​
A library of consistent, reusable front-end UI patterns means a more cohesive UX and brand experience across apps and services. Fewer support requests from residents and cost savings for agencies.​

### Better Standardization​
A clear repository of best practices reduces confusion and decreases the time it takes for new engineers and vendors to ramp up.​

### Accessible by Default
Built-in accessibility testing and automation means a greater chance that people with disabilities will be able to use our software (and reduced liability for agencies.)​
