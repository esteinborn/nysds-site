# Getting Started

New York State Design System (NYSDS) is system for building New York State web applications and content websites. It's created to help the people designing and developing digital experiences to do so in a way that is **consistent**, **user-friendly**, and **accessible**. No matter what role you play in the creation of these digital experiences, NYSDS has value to offer: big-picture framing, clear guidance, and ready-to-use resources.

## Why NYSDS?

Every day, New York State residents interact with digital services. They expect clear and accessible experiences. Without a unified approach, teams often create their own solutions. This often results in duplicated work, inconsistent designs, and accessibility challenges.

NYSDS solves this by providing:

- **Proven Best Practices:** From intuitive design to strict WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards, every element is created with residents in mind.
- **A Shared Language:** Our design and code libraries are closely aligned so that what designers and business analysts create while prototyping designs is based in the reality of what can quickly be built in code.
- **Efficiency & Scalability:** Prebuilt components, design tokens, and guidelines make developers more efficient and keep experiences consistent across platforms.

## Bridging Design and Development

One of the greatest challenges in digital product creation is ensuring that the vision in design translates perfectly into code. NYSDS eliminates this gap:

- **Seamless Parity:** Our Figma libraries and code libraries are synchronized so that design elements and code components match 1:1.
- **Consistent Experience:** Colors, spacing, and typography remain uniform across applications.
- **Built-in Accessibility:** With accessibility integrated into every component, teams reduce compliance risks and avoid costly rework.
